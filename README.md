# Car-Prediction
This is a Machine Learning model which predicts the price of the car based on the information given to the model.

#### I have searched the Dataset on Kaggle provided by CARDEKHO.com 
[cardekho dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/nehalbirla/vehicle-dataset-from-cardekho)

```
    
    This dataset contains information about used cars listed on ![web](www.cardekho.com)
    This data can be used for a lot of purposes such as price prediction to exemplify the use of linear regression in Machine Learning.
    The columns in the given dataset are as follows:

    name
    year
    selling_price
    km_driven
    fuel
    seller_type
    transmission
    Owner

```

*Here Selling price is the column that is to be predicted while all other are the independent columns*

**I have used XGBOOST to train my model. Which is an ensemble technique and performs best for both regressions and classifications.**
